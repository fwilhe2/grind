//! Namespace URIs, relationship types, and the flavour they say the file is.
//!
//! The `core/src/odf/names.rs` of the OOXML family, and the same two rules: **dispatch on
//! `(namespace-uri, local-name)` and never on the prefix written in the document**, and **an
//! unrecognised URI is a value rather than a failure** — it resolves to [`Ns::Other`], every
//! lookup against it misses, and the element routes down the ignore path in `xml.rs`.
//!
//! What is different here is that every Part 1 namespace comes in **two** spellings.
//! ISO/IEC 29500 defines Transitional and Strict, real files are overwhelmingly Transitional,
//! and the entire difference that reaches a reader is this file (`doc/xlsx-import.md`,
//! "Transitional, and the real world"; `doc/docx-import.md` says the same of Word). Both families resolve to the same [`Ns`], so nothing
//! downstream branches on the flavour; the reader only *records* which it saw, because that
//! is a useful sentence in a report and a useless one in a parser.
//!
//! Every URI below is `MEASURED` — see `doc/xlsx-format.md` §1.1 and §1.2, and
//! `doc/docx-format.md` §1, for the files and the commands.
//!
//! **One table for both filters, and that is not R8 bending.** R8 keeps a document type's
//! vocabulary out of `grind-core`; this crate is not the core, it is the OOXML family's own
//! container layer, and SpreadsheetML and WordprocessingML share every part of it but their
//! main namespace — the relationships, the drawing language, OPC and markup compatibility.

/// A namespace this filter recognises. Everything else is [`Ns::Other`].
